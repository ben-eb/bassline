#Bassline

Bassline is a tool that generates a baseline typographic grid, to help you establish a consistent vertical rhythm for layouts on the web.

##Usage

Simply drag the sliders on the left hand side to achieve the desired font size/line height combination. The changes will appear dynamically on the right hand side; copy the CSS from the textarea and paste it into your project. Elements marked with a pencil can have their font size adjusted independently of the main font size; these will *not* adjust when the base font size is changed.

##Issues

###Known issues

* Some combinations of font size and line height will break the grid generated. The best way around this problem is to try a slightly different line height/font size combination!
* Because the grid lines are generated with a gradient, they will only appear in *new* versions of WebKit (Safari/Chrome) and Gecko (Firefox) based browsers.
* This has not been designed to work in IE! Use a WebKit (best) or Gecko based browser.
