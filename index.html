				<h1>Agent Whiskers</h1>
				<h2>Electronic Music from Saudi Arabia</h2>
				<h3>About</h3>
				<p class="bass-p">Saudi Arabia isn't a country known for its music scene. Being almost universally frowned upon by the government and society, it can be very difficult for a musician to hone their craft when music is constantly a source for crackdowns. But somewhere in the recesses of the conservative oil-rich desert, several musicians took it upon themselves to form a music scene with the aim of spreading awareness about the talent this country is ironically home to. Essam Alghamdi has been a part of this scene since its heyday beginning in 2002. Having played in dozens of bands in a wide range of rock and metal genres (from Grindcore to Grunge/Punk) as both a guitarist and a drummer, Essam managed to build up a repertoire of skills which paved the way for Agent Whiskers' unique and inspired electronic sound.</p>
				<p class="bass-p">With a style influenced by Radiohead and early Muse, along with the unpredictable song structure of grindcore, Agent Whiskers provides a fresh take on a genre widely known for limited releases and remixes, offering songwriting that's rich, rewarding and emotive. Given the ease of recording music on computers, Whiskers started writing his first album in January 2011, with the aim of offering a seamless, narrative structure to the album, taking listeners on a journey from the first track to the final track. Released in July 2011, Agent Whiskers' first album 'Abstract Forms of Solace' was a surprise to many who have heard Essam's previous work. An intensely intimate experience, Abstract features 8 tracks unfolding a story with every song and molding itself in the confines of the instruments at play.</p>
				<p class="bass-p">Wasting no time, Agent Whiskers completed work on his sophomore release "Stage 2: The Path Untaken" less than 3 months after the release of Abstract. Featuring the same cohesive elements that made the first album a standout, "Stage 2" offers a more upbeat, video game-esque electronic experience. The album also incorporates a plot told via song names with the help of the accompanying atmosphere of the songs, taking you on a journey through 7 detailed and nuanced tracks.</p> 
				<p class="bass-p">A sequel to "Stage 2" is currently in the works with a darker, more oppressed take on Electronic music.</p>
				<h3>Reviews</h3>
				<blockquote>
					<p class="bass-p">Agent Whiskers is a name to remember. Stage 2: The Path Untaken, is one of the most intriguing and exquisite albums to come out this year. This is one piece of music that you will want to give a listen to. You can tell all of your friends you knew about Agent Whiskers before he took over the music world as we know it.</p>

				<blockquote>
					<p class="bass-p">It's clear [Agent Whiskers] changed his direction slightly and it works. I thoroughly enjoyed the flow of "Downpour (Finding Love in a Post-Apocalyptic World)". The rain plus thunder added a nice feel to it. A majority of these tracks could easily be heard as you slay virtual dragons and cast spells as you explore and conquer levels. It's a solid follow-up to his debut.</p>
